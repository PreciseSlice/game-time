      In software engineering, rubber duck debugging or rubber ducking is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to
      a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their
      code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ducky's Demise is for all programmers to throw code at rubber ducks and eliminate their code problems one at a time
